Procedural Mountains is a small program that proceduraly generates mountain ranges and stars. It is coded in Java and used LibGDX to render the mountains and stars. The program works by generating random numbers with a set of criteria for the startpoint and endpoint of a series of lines. It then draws two triangles underneath each line to fill in the mountain. Their is curently a but where some of the mountains require a third triangle so there is an odd triangular hole in some of the mountains. I will try and fix this as soon as I can. This project is open source but if anyone uses it, could they credit it to Mad Pixel Games.
